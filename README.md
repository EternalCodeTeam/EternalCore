## EternalCore DI
Dependency Injection (DI) is an object-oriented programming design pattern that enhances flexibility, maintainability, and modularity by managing component dependencies. It allows an external source to inject dependencies into a class, reducing tight coupling and improving testability.

Key DI concepts include:
- **Beans** (instances of classes managed by the bean container)
- **Bean container** (stores beans)
- **Dependent class** (those needing dependencies from the bean container)

Used DI type
**Constructor Injection:** Dependencies are injected through the class's constructor for immediate object validity.

### How to use DI
#### 1. Repository
```java
@Repository // <- means a class that will be injected into other classes. (dependency)
public class ExampleRepositoryImpl implements ExampleRepository {
    // Implementation
}
```

#### 6. Config
```java
@ConfigurationYml // <- marks a class that will be registered and loaded as a config.
public class ExampleConfiguration implements ReloadableConfig {
    String example = "example";
    int exampleInt = 1;
    boolean exampleBoolean = true;

    @Override
    public Resource resource(File folder) {
        return Source.of(folder, "example.yml");
    }
}
```

#### 2. Service / Manager etc.
```java
@Service // <- means a class that will be injected into other classes. (dependency)
public class ExampleService {
    
    private final ExampleRepository exampleRepository;
    
    @Inject // <- marks a class as dependent on other classes. (dependent class)
    public ExampleService(ExampleRepository exampleRepository) {
        this.exampleRepository = exampleRepository;
    }
    
}
```

#### 3. Bukkit task
```java
@Task(delay = 20L, unit = TimeUnit.SECONDS) // <- marks a class that will be registered as a task.
public class ExampleTask implements Runnable {
    
    private final ExampleService exampleService;
    
    @Inject // <- marks a class as dependent on other classes. (dependent class)
    public ExampleTask(ExampleService exampleService) {
        this.exampleService = exampleService;
    }
    
    @Override
    public void run() {
        // do something
    }
    
}
```
#### 4. Bukkit listener
```java
@EventListener // <- marks a class that will be registered as a bukkit listener.
public class ExampleListener implements Listener {
    
    private final ExampleService exampleService;
    
    @Inject // <- marks a class as dependent on other classes. (dependent class)
    public ExampleListener(ExampleService exampleService) {
        this.exampleService = exampleService;
    }
    
    @EventHandler
    void onExampleEvent(AsyncPlayerJoinEvent event) {
        // do something
    }
    
}
```
#### 5. Command
```java
@Route(name = "example") // <- marks a class that will be registered as a command.
public class ExampleCommand {
    
    private final ExampleService exampleService;
    
    @Inject // <- marks a class as dependent on other classes. (dependent class)
    public ExampleCommand(ExampleService exampleService) {
        this.exampleService = exampleService;
    }
    
    @Execute
    void onExampleCommand(CommandSender sender, @Arg String arg) {
        // do something
    }
    
}
```

#### 7. BeanSetup
BeanSetup is a class that allows you to register beans in the bean container.
It is used to register dependencies that are cannot be registered in the bean container using annotations. e.g. MiniMessage, AdventureProvider, HikariDataSource, etc.
```java

@BeanSetup // <- marks a class that will be registered as a bean holder.
public class ExampleBeanSetup {

    @Bean // <- marks a method that will be registered as a bean. (dependency)
    public ExampleProvider exampleProvider() {
        ExampleProviderImpl exampleProvider = new ExampleProviderImpl();
        exampleProvider.doSomething();
        
        return new ExampleProviderImpl();
    }
    
    @Bean // <- marks a method that will be registered as a bean. (dependency)
    public OtherProvider otherProvider(Server server) {
        return new OtherProvider(server);
    }

}
```
